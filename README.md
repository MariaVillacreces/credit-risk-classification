## Overview of the Analysis

* the purpose of the analysis is to split the data into training and testing sets in order to create a regression model with the original data to identify goood borrowers.
i had some determinant variables and data that played a role in this lending process report such as the loan itself, debt, borrower financials etc.
the stages as mentioned before had the spliting data and creating the training model in order to make the predictions using the regression model.

## Results

* with the regression model i've achieve the below results:
                 precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       1.00      0.99      1.00     18765
           1       0.85      0.91      0.88       619

## Summary
to conclude, the logistic regression model predicted with a precision of 100% for healthy loans and 85% for high-risk loans. These results to me are ok but not excellent due to the discrepancy of 15% between then but we can see some level of performance. with the recall and F1 score we see similar results and the gap being less than the precision demostrating better results.
